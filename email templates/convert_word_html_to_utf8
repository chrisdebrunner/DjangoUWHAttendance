open the file in emacs, and conver all curly brackets that are not enclosing python substitutions with double open and close curly brackets
(ie { -> {{ and } -> }}). Also move the "{CurrentQuarterInvoiceTableRowsHTML}" python tag from the cell at the end of the row to between the
rows (between the </tr> and the <tr> tags). To convert the file to utf-8, press "C-X C-M f" and enter utf-8, then save with "C-X C-S".
