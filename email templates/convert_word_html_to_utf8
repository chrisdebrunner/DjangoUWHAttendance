Save the file in Word as "Web Page, Filtered (.htm)". 

Open the file in emacs, and convert all curly brackets that are not enclosing python 
substitutions with double open and close curly brackets (ie { -> {{ and } -> }}). 

The following changes may not be necessary, but you should check:
Reduce the second column width from 287 to 80 (215.2 pt to 60 pt) and the third 
column width from 280 to 80 (209.95 pt to 60 pt).
For the first and last rows, reduce the first column width from 661 to 454 
(495.9 pt to 340.5 pt) and the second column width from 280 to 80 
(209.95 pt to 60 pt).
This can can be accomplished by replacing 661 with 454, 495.9 with 340.5, 
287 with 80, 215.2 with 60, 280 with 80, and 209.95 with 60.

Also move all but the first and last two table rows to the file "UWH Quarterly 
Player Invoice Template CurrentQuarterInvoiceTableRows.html" and replace them with
"{CurrentQuarterInvoiceTableRowsHTML}" python tag.

Also make sure the href in the paypal.me link has curly brackets in it rather 
than %7b and %7d. 

To convert the file to utf-8, press "C-X C-M f" and enter utf-8, then save with 
"C-X C-W" to the same file name with " utf8" appended.
